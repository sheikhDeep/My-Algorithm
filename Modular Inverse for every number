//Here 'm' is prime number. 

Proof:-

We have:
  m mod i = m − ⌊m/i⌋⋅ i
Taking both sides modulo m yields:
  m mod i ≡ − ⌊m/i⌋ ⋅ i mod m
Multiply both sides by i^−1 ⋅ (m mod i) ^− 1 yields
  (m mod i) ⋅ i^−1 ⋅ (m mod i)^−1 ≡ −⌊m/i⌋ ⋅ i ⋅ i^−1 ⋅ (m mod i)^−1 mod m,
which simplifies to:
  i^−1 ≡ −⌊m/i⌋⋅ (m mod i)^−1 mod m .
  



//Implementation

inv[1] = 1;
for(int i = 2; i < m; ++i)
    inv[i] = (m - (m/i) * inv[m%i] % m) % m;
